        <p>American Sign Language is one of many sign languages used predominantly by individuals who are hard of hearing.
            More specifically, fingerspelling is the act of spelling out individual letters majorly in order to spell out
            words the user might not know. CNN Classification of American Sign language is a burgeoning field in the current
            landscape of Machine Learning image classification, and is being used to make education more accessible for deaf students
            in the face of the COVID pandemic. This project was completed as part of Boston College's undergraduate Machine Learning course,
            with the end-product being a convolutional neural network trained to classify images of fingerspelled letters.
