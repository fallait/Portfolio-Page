        <p>Christmas Music has remained a hallmark of the holiday season, with the songs each year often having similar features and lyrics.
            Done as a part of the Visualization course at Boston College, this webpage used D3 to create some novel visualizations of the Billboard
            Holiday Charts and of the lyrical makeup of many of these popular classics.
